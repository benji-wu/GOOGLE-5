I chose a content-based recommendation approach using a text dataset. Since Iâ€™m working with movie plots (or song lyrics), collaborative filtering is not suitable due to lack of user interaction data. Instead, I will convert plot/lyrics text into embeddings and recommend items with similar semantic meaning.
